    <p>I didn’t enter technology through tutorials or certifications.
       I entered it by breaking things.</p>
    
    <p>At the age of 12, I got my first computer — a Dell desktop with an Intel Dual Core processor, 2GB DDR2 RAM, a 512GB hard drive, and Windows XP. When the system started beeping, I didn’t panic — I opened it. I disassembled the CPU just to understand why it was failing. That curiosity stayed with me.</p>

    <p>In my early school years, technology meant experimenting. Filling the second DDR2 slot after two years felt like unlocking a new level — games ran smoother, the system felt alive. Windows 7 came next (unlicensed, but unforgettable), and I slowly realized that operating systems weren’t just interfaces — they were systems managing resources.</p>

    <p>My real shift happened when I encountered Unix-like systems. I didn’t even know CMD or PowerShell existed in Windows, but the Linux CLI immediately felt different — direct, honest, and powerful. Installing Linux without an internet connection took months. Pendrives, CDs, internet cafés, late nights, USB tethering from a terrace — all just to make the system boot.</p>

    <p>When Kali Linux finally ran, it wasn’t the hacking tools that hooked me — it was the visibility into the system. Tools like Wireshark, Nmap, Burp Suite introduced me to how networks and systems actually behave. I didn’t understand everything, but I knew this was the direction.</p>

    <p>During my +1 and +2, most people barely touched computers. I lived inside them.</p>

    <p>By the time I entered my B.Tech in Computer Science, my focus shifted again — from security curiosity to understanding systems internally: how operating systems work, how backend services communicate, how performance and scale emerge from design choices. Getting a Mac with the M1 chip only deepened this interest — different architecture, different trade-offs, same curiosity.</p>

    <p>Today, Linux is my daily driver. I’m comfortable living in the terminal — using simple tools like grep, ls -al, and cd to explore systems rather than abstract them away. When something breaks, I read logs, search deeply, and experiment until the system reveals its behavior.</p>

    <p>I currently work on backend development and am actively building my foundation in web technologies and AWS. I’m at the beginning of serious system design work — and that excites me. I’m not chasing trends; I’m chasing understanding.</p>

    <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
    <p>I believe good systems are not built by accident.
They are built by engineers who:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand internals, not just APIs</li>
        <li>Respect constraints like performance, scale, and failure</li>
        <li>Treat logs, metrics, and failures as first-class signals</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My long-term goal is to become the go-to infrastructure and system architecture engineer — someone trusted to design, debug, and scale critical systems — and to work on large-scale cloud platforms like AWS.</p>

    <p>And this is ME</p>
